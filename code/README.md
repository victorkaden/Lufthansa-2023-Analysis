# Lufthansa Analysis Project - Code Overview

This document provides an overview of the SQL queries and Python scripts used to perform the analysis and create the visualizations for the **Lufthansa Analysis Project**.

---

## 1. SQL Queries for Data Extraction and Cleaning

### Extracting Total Flights and Busiest Airports
```sql
SELECT airport_name, COUNT(flight_id) AS total_flights
FROM lufthansa_flights
GROUP BY airport_name
ORDER BY total_flights DESC;
```

### Filtering Monthly Flight Data
```sql
SELECT MONTH(flight_date) AS month, COUNT(flight_id) AS total_flights
FROM lufthansa_flights
GROUP BY MONTH(flight_date)
ORDER BY month;
```

### Summarizing Revenue by Airport
```sql
SELECT airport_name, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM lufthansa_revenue
GROUP BY airport_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### Passenger Demographics by Age Group
```sql
SELECT age_group, COUNT(passenger_id) AS total_passengers
FROM lufthansa_passengers
GROUP BY age_group
ORDER BY total_passengers DESC;
```

### Identifying Average Delay Duration
```sql
SELECT route_type, AVG(delay_duration) AS avg_delay
FROM lufthansa_delays
GROUP BY route_type
ORDER BY avg_delay;
```

## 2. Python Scripts for Analysis and Visualization

### Importing Required Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

### Visualization 1: Flight Volume by Major Hubs
```python
# Sample data for flight volume
hubs = ['Frankfurt', 'Munich', 'Berlin', 'Hamburg']
flights = [45000, 32000, 15000, 12000]

# Plotting the data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(hubs, flights, color='skyblue')
plt.title('Flight Volume by Lufthansa's Major Hubs (2023)')
plt.xlabel('Hub Airport')
plt.ylabel('Number of Flights')
plt.show()
```

### Visualization 2: Monthly Flight Trends
```python
# Sample data for monthly flight trends
months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']
flight_counts = [3000, 3200, 3400, 3600, 4000, 4500, 4800, 4700, 4200, 4000, 3800, 3500]

# Plotting the data
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(months, flight_counts, marker='o', color='green')
plt.title('Monthly Flight Trends (2023)')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Number of Flights')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Visualization 3: Revenue Contribution by Airport
```python
# Sample data for revenue by airport
airports = ['Frankfurt', 'Munich', 'Berlin', 'Hamburg']
revenue = [750, 500, 200, 150]  # Revenue in millions

# Plotting the data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(airports, revenue, color='orange')
plt.title('Revenue Contribution by Airport (in Millions)')
plt.xlabel('Airport')
plt.ylabel('Revenue (in Millions EUR)')
plt.show()
```

### Visualization 4: Passenger Demographics by Age Group
```python
# Sample data for passenger demographics
age_groups = ['18-30', '30-50', '50+']
passengers = [12000, 18000, 10000]

# Plotting the data
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.bar(age_groups, passengers, color='purple')
plt.title('Passenger Demographics by Age Group')
plt.xlabel('Age Group')
plt.ylabel('Number of Passengers')
plt.show()
```

### Visualization 5: Average Delay Duration by Route Type
```python
# Sample data for average delay duration
route_types = ['Domestic', 'International']
delays = [10, 15]  # Average delay in minutes

# Plotting the data
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.bar(route_types, delays, color='red')
plt.title('Average Delay Duration by Route Type')
plt.xlabel('Route Type')
plt.ylabel('Average Delay (Minutes)')
plt.show()
```

## 3. Summary of Visualizations
1. **Flight Volume by Major Hubs** – A bar chart showing the number of flights handled by Lufthansa’s key hubs.
2. **Monthly Flight Trends** – A line chart illustrating seasonal peaks and dips in flight operations.
3. **Revenue Contribution by Airport** – A bar chart depicting the revenue generated by each major airport.
4. **Passenger Demographics by Age Group** – A bar chart highlighting the distribution of passengers by age.
5. **Average Delay Duration by Route Type** – A bar chart comparing average delays for domestic and international routes.
